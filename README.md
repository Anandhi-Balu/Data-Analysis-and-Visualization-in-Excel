This project utilizes Microsoft Excelâ€™s Power Query Editor for efficient data extraction, transformation, and loading of the 2023 FNP sales dataset. The resulting dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of sales performance by visualizing revenue trends across key dimensions such as occasions, item categories, order days, and months. This project provides valuable insights for a data-driven understanding of sales patterns and customer engagement.
