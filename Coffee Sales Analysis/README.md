# Coffee Sales Analysis:

The “Coffee Sales Analysis” project involved a comprehensive examination of sales performance across different roast types from 2019 to 2022. Through data analysis in Microsoft Excel, the following key insights and visualizations were generated:

* **Total Sales Over Time**: This line chart tracks the revenue generated by different coffee roast types (Arabica, Excelsa, Librica, Robusta) from 2019 to 2022, highlighting periods of peak and low performance. This allows for identifying the most popular roast types in different timeframes. Excelsa coffee type had the highest sales in 2019, Arabica in 2020 and 2021, and Librica in 2022.

* **Sales by Country**: This horizontal bar chart compares the total revenue generated from sales in different countries (the United States, Ireland, United Kingdom). This helps in understanding key geographical markets. The United States generated the highest revenue at $35,639, followed by Ireland with $6,697, while the United Kingdom had the lowest sales at $2,799.

* **Top 5 Customers**: This horizontal bar chart identifies the top 5 customers based on their total purchase value. It showcases the most valuable clients and their contribution to revenue. This information is crucial for customer relationship management and loyalty programs. Customers Allis Wilmore, Brenn Dundredge, Terri Farra, Nealson Cuttler, and Don Flintiff hold the top five spots, in that order.
